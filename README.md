# Java 8: Lambda Expressions & Streams

This is the source code of the presentation Lambda Expressions and Streams created by Lucas Saldanha.

The presentation is an introduction of the new features of Lambda expressions and Streams of the JDK 8.

The slides are available at [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/lucassaldanha/java-8-lambda-and-streams).

I wrote two blog posts about this presentation. Here is the link to them:
